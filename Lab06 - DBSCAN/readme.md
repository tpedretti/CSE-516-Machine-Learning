# Lab 6 - DBSCAN

Here is the portal for uploading the DBSCAN implementation (Matlab only) (total: 40)

You can find the dataset s2.dat for testing your code and the helper function findNeighbors.m in the attachment.

Upload the source code and a screen shot of  the output (in this case, the scatter plot which shows the clustering)

Deadline : 3/4/2020

Late submission deadline :

3/9/2020  10% deduction

3/11/2020 20% deduction


1. The program should be able to work with high dimensional data even you test the program with 2-D data (use matrix representation and think in a matrix way) (10 points)

2. Program works and the clustering is correct. (5 points)

3. Correct implementation of the main.m (or equivalent, 10 points)

4. Correct implementation of the extendCluster.m (or equivalent, 15 points)
